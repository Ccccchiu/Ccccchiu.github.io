                                <p>This canteen offers a rich variety of foods. It has the lowest prices among the 3 canteens. The canteen is quite large and has many seats, but the seats is narrow and it’s usually crowded. The Starbucks in AC1 is recommended because it’s cheaper than external Starbucks stores.</p>

                                <p>Fewer food options and higher prices than AC1. Foods is nothing special, but the Hong Kong style milk tea is good. The canteen has many seats, which are quite spacious. It’s less crowded than AC1 and you can even see students studying here.</p>

                                <p>AC3 has the fewest food options among the canteens. It’s relatively expensive, but the taste is better. Seats are limited, but more spacious than AC1. There are some view-facing seats, which are worth a try.</p>
